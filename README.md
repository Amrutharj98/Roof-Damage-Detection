# Roof-Damage-Detection
### Description:

Developed an AI-driven system to automate roof damage assessment for insurance claims, reducing manual inspections and processing time. The system integrates machine learning and deep learning techniques to detect roofs, segment roof areas, classify tile types, and assess damage severity.

### Key Tasks:

#### âœ” Roof Detection: Identified whether the uploaded image contains a roof.
#### âœ” Roof Segmentation: Isolated the roof area to enhance damage detection accuracy.
#### âœ” Tile Type Identification: Classified roof tiles as clay roof tiles or natural slate roof tiles using an ensemble model.
#### âœ” Damage Detection & Severity Estimation: Used YOLO-based object detection to localize damaged areas and compute damage percentage.
